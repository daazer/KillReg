# README for KillReg Script

## Overview
`killreg` is a Bash script designed for Unix-like operating systems to terminate processes that match a given pattern. It allows for an optional signal specification to control how the processes are terminated.

## Usage
- Basic Command: `./killreg <PATTERN>`
- With Signal: `./killreg [-SIGNAL] <PATTERN>`

### Arguments
- `-SIGNAL`: An optional signal to send to the matching processes, e.g., `-9` for SIGKILL, `-TERM` for SIGTERM. Default is `-TERM`.
- `PATTERN`: A required argument. The script will terminate all processes that match this pattern.

### Examples
- To terminate processes matching `myapp`: `./killreg myapp`
- To forcibly terminate processes matching `myapp`: `./killreg -9 myapp`

## Requirements
- Bash shell
- Unix-like operating system
- User must have necessary permissions to terminate the targeted processes.

## Error Handling
The script checks for:
- Minimum requirement of one argument.
- Correct format when two arguments are provided (first argument should start with a hyphen).

## Note
Use this script with caution as terminating critical system processes can lead to system instability.
